# Centralized-Mutual-Exclusion-Algorithm
The system comprises three components. The first is a Resource Server, which contains a resource that only one process can access at a time. The second is a Coordinator, which controls access to the resource on a first-come-first-server basis. The third component is a set of client processes that may request access to the resource.

This project is implemented with Java's Socket Programming.
